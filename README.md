# readkit

ReadKit, a viewer/extractor/converter for scripted documents which does not require TclKit or MetaKit.

This is the Tcl only version to read Metakit files which was originally code by Jean-Claude Wippler.

This repository contains a version which should be a candidate for inclusion into [Tcllib](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/).

For this the package needs proper documentation and probably some fixes.
